# magrathea-cli
An (unofficial) simple CLI for Magrathea Telecom's [NTSAPI](http://www.magrathea-telecom.co.uk/assets/Client-Downloads/Numbering-API-Instructions.pdf).

This project is a work in progress, so portions of the API are missing. (Most notably, the block allocate and account management functions.)

# Getting started

```
npm install -g https://github.com/jamiek23/magrathea-cli
```
